		// Chert start
		"CHERT_START_1": "Hello there! Is this your first launch? Welcome to the Hourglass Twins.",
		"CHERT_START_2": "Yes, it is. What are you doing here exactly?",
		"CHERT_START_3": "Let’s celebrate Christmas! I’m helping travelers get home for the celebration.",
		"CHERT_START_4": "Star charts, you know. This is a great place to spot astronomical events, such as supernovae.",
		"CHERT_START_5": "I’ve actually seen a couple today. They're very rare.",
		"CHERT_START_6": "I see.",
		"CHERT_START_7": "So, what can I help you with?",
		"CHERT_START_8": "Let’s celebrate Christmas! I’m helping travelers get home for the celebration.",
		"CHERT_START_9": "Nothing. Have a nice day!",
		"CHERT_START_10": "What do you mean? Should I just leave my place and interrupt such important work? Absolutely not.",
		"CHERT_START_11": "Oh, the thing is, we're in a time loop. Our sun will soon go supernova. I've seen it happen many times now. Also, I've already explored everything, so you can go back home.",
		"CHERT_START_12": "Ha-ha, you’re very funny! Go on, tell me what you know then.",
		"CHERT_START_13": "The Eye of the Universe was found by species from a nearby solar system, and their cloaked ship is still here.",
		"CHERT_START_14": "Uh-huh...",
		"CHERT_START_15": "The Nomai came from another solar system too, but they were not able to find the Eye because its signal was blocked by the first species.",
		"CHERT_START_16": "Uh-huh.. go on...",
		"CHERT_START_17": "The Nomai made a time-loop machine to find the Eye but died when ghost matter from the Interloper blanketed the solar system.",
		"CHERT_START_18": "Wow. I was expecting you to say something like \"Sure, I was joking, gotcha! \" but... this...",
		"CHERT_START_20": "It sounds unbelievable... all of it!",
		"CHERT_START_21": "But alright, let’s make a deal: I will go to Timber Hearth if you can prove everything you said.",
		"CHERT_START_22": "Sure! I already know the exact things you're about to ask: secret information that only you could know, unknown Nomai tech, and any other kind of tech.",
		"CHERT_START_23": "Alright! How do we do this?",
		"CHERT_START_24": "So, if you’re saying you’re in a time loop, you can prove it by telling me something that only I could know.",
		"CHERT_START_25": "You can say: \"Chert, I know that only you know who the inventor of Jumbo Marshmallows is\".",
		"CHERT_START_26": "Who is it?",
		"CHERT_START_27": "Alright, will that be enough?",
		"CHERT_START_28": "It’s a big secret. Maybe one day you will know, but for now, it’s the only thing I could say.",
		"CHERT_START_29": "Alright, will that be enough?",
		"CHERT_START_30": "No, since you’re saying you are Mr. ’I know everything,’ I’m asking you to bring something new to the table.",
		"CHERT_START_31": "I mean, any unknown Nomai technology, and don’t you dare take anything from the museum!",
		"CHERT_START_32": "What else did you say? The other species’ ship is still here? Cool, bring me a piece of their tech, and we’re good.",
		"CHERT_START_33": "So, the deal is the secret phrase, some unknown Nomai tech, and something significant from another civilization’s tech. Deal?",
		"CHERT_START_34": "Deal. You better prepare to fly home!",
		"CHERT_START_35": "Chert, I know that only you know who the inventor of Jumbo Marshmallows is.",
		"CHERT_START_36": "Oh, that was witty. Tell me that in the next loop in case you’re not lying.",
		"CHERT_START_37": "Okay, I will. Bye.",
		"CHERT_START_38": "Chert, I know that only you know who the inventor of Jumbo Marshmallows is.",
		"CHERT_START_39": "Good luck, lad!",
		"CHERT_START_40": "Ha-ha.",
		"CHERT_START_41": "So, I’m waiting for all the proof.",
		"CHERT_START_43": "Here’s the Nomai warp core. They used it to enable the time loop machine.",
		"CHERT_START_44": "Here’s the strangers tech.",
		"CHERT_START_45": "Take a look at this item.",
		"CHERT_START_46": "So, I’ve done everything you asked for. Now will you come home and celebrate?",
		"CHERT_START_47": "I’ll be right back.",
		"CHERT_START_48": "B-o-o-o-ring. Bring something significant!",
		"CHERT_START_49": "Wow. That really is the one thing that only I knew. Well, not anymore.",
		"CHERT_START_50": "Sure! I’ll prove everything.",
		"CHERT_START_51": "I... I’m speechless... wait, if it’s enabling the time loop and I can’t see any wires connecting it to anything...",
		"CHERT_START_52": "OH NO! PUT IT BACK! NOW!",
		"CHERT_START_53": "Oh, don’t be upset Chert. I’ll figure it out. Calm down!",
		"CHERT_START_54": "Uh... easy for you to say! Okay, take a deep breath... inhale... exhale...",
		"CHERT_START_55": "Anyway...",
		"CHERT_START_56": "What an interesting artifact! It seems like the main concept of their technology is based on some sort of light or flame, am I right?",
		"CHERT_START_57": "Yes. They were all about flames and lights.",
		"CHERT_START_58": "Okay... you won. I don’t feel like I’m doing something important here, so... we can go celebrate Christmas!",
		"CHERT_START_59": "Yay! Let’s go, my ship is nearby.",
		"CHERT_START_60": "Wait a sec. I need to bring my ship closer.",
		"CHERT_START_61": "Oh no, my ship is destroyed. Sorry.",
		"CHERT_START_62": "Oh well, it’s alright. I don’t really need your ship. Mine is functioning. See ya!",
		"CHERT_START_63": "Bon voyage!",
		"CHERT_START_64": "Actually... yeah. That’s what I was thinking too. Nice guess!",
		"CHERT_START_65": "So, are you serious about all this?",
		"CHERT_START_66": "Yes! Let’s get down to business.",

		// Chert tree
		"CHERT_TREE_1": "Hey! I wanted to ask... how do you cope with all your knowledge?",
		"CHERT_TREE_2": "I’m okay, Chert.",
		"CHERT_TREE_3": "I can imagine...",
		"CHERT_TREE_4": "Oh, is that how those Strangers looked?",
		"CHERT_TREE_5": "Yes, exactly.",
		"CHERT_TREE_6": "They were a little creepy and had just two eyes!",
		"CHERT_TREE_7": "Yeah, they were very different and a little creepy.",

		// Ernesto
		"ERNESTO_START_1": "...",
		"ERNESTO_START_2": "Oh, Ernesto, you shine so bright!",
		"ERNESTO_START_3": "We need your lights to finally start the celebration!",

		// Esker ship
		"ESKER_SHIP_1": "I don’t remember the last time I was in a spaceship...",
		"ESKER_SHIP_2": "Alright, we’re here! Let’s go celebrate!",
		"ESKER_SHIP_3": "I’ll let you know when we land near the village.",
		"ESKER_SHIP_8": "You even brought your chair? Really, Esker?",
		"ESKER_SHIP_9": "Yes! What, you wanted me to leave it on the moon?",
		"ESKER_SHIP_10": "No way.",
		"ESKER_SHIP_4": "Let’s go! Merry Christmas!",
		"ESKER_SHIP_5": "So, the flight is over?",
		"ESKER_SHIP_7": "Yes, we’re here! Let’s go celebrate!",
		"ESKER_SHIP_6": "No, but I’ll tell you when we’re about to land.",

		// Esker start
		"ESKER_START_1": "Hey-hey! So you're here to bring me home, right?",
		"ESKER_START_2": "Wait, what? How did you know?",
		"ESKER_START_3": "Well... I get lonely up here, so I listen in on the village with my signalscope a lot... I just heard your conversation with Slate.",
		"ESKER_START_4": "Oh, I see... You scare me sometimes, Esker.",
		"ESKER_START_5": "So... what’s next? Are we going home?",
		"ESKER_START_6": "Yes! I need you to celebrate Christmas. Let’s go!",
		"ESKER_START_7": "Yes, but don’t go anywhere. I need to bring my ship closer.",
		"ESKER_START_8": "I’m sorry, Esker, but it seems like my ship isn't working anymore. My bad.",
		"ESKER_START_9": "Hold on, I need to do something first.",
		"ESKER_START_10": "Alright, I’ll wait for you!",
		"ESKER_START_11": "No celebration then? Sad... We can still hang out here around my campfire, you know...",
		"ESKER_START_12": "Gotcha! I’ll wait then.",

		// Esker tree
		"ESKER_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! Gotta say you’re good pilot.",
		"ESKER_TREE_2": "Thanks! I know I’m pretty good at it.",
		"ESKER_TREE_3": "Do you know anything about Jumbo?",
		"ESKER_TREE_4": "Yes, you’re also very modest.",
		"ESKER_TREE_5": "Who?",
		"ESKER_TREE_6": "Actually... nevermind...",

		// Feldspar note
		"FELDSPAR_NOTE": "Okay, I’m leaving this damned place now. I’m not sure if I’ll succeed without my ship, but at least I’ll try. Feldspar.",

		// Feldspar ship
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_1": "Nice ship, captain! I’ll have to ask Slate to make a similar one for me. Let me know when we land near the Village, okay?",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_2": "We’re already home, welcome back!",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_3": "Sure! I’ll let you know.",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_4": "Yay! Thanks for the ride. Let’s go celebrate!",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_5": "Are we home yet, hatchling?",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_6": "Nope, not yet. I’ll let you know when we're there.",

		// Feldspar start
		"FELDSPAR_START_1": "Hey bud! I’m glad you found me. Can you help me escape from this cursed place?",
		"FELDSPAR_START_2": "Why did you leave the anglerfish skeleton? It was safe there!",
		"FELDSPAR_START_3": "Sure! Let’s go.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_4": "Don’t go anywhere, I’ll bring my ship closer.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_5": "I’m so sorry... but my ship is not functioning... we’re stuck here.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_6": "It was boring there. I saw a little anglerfish and thought it could help me fly away from Dark Bramble, so I followed it and... then I ended up here...",
		"FELDSPAR_START_7": "Pure luck! I was so scared that I wasn’t able to move. It seems like anglerfish react only to movement. Ha-ha! Another mystery solved!",
		"FELDSPAR_START_8": "Wow, yeah that really is pure luck!",
		"FELDSPAR_START_9": "So... can you get us out of here?",
		"FELDSPAR_START_10": "Don’t go anywhere? Ha-ha.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_11": "Oh boy... what are we gonna do?",

		// Feldspar tree
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! I have to admit it, I missed the Village.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_2": "Glad you’re here, Feldspar.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_4": "Yeah, me too. Space adventures can wait sometimes, you know.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_5": "Who’s that? That guy looks EXACTLY like you.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_6": "Well, they are literally me. From the past.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_7": "My nephew.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_8": "Ummm, I don’t know, actually.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_9": "Ha-ha-ha. Very funny. VERY.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_10": "Really? I never knew that. Hm.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_11": "Okay, but it’s weird.",

		// Gabbro start
		"GABBRO_START_1": "Hey, it’s you! Congrats on the first launch.",
		"GABBRO_START_2": "I don’t know why, but I keep dying repeatedly. Sounds weird, huh?",
		"GABBRO_START_3": "Yes, we already had this conversation.",
		"GABBRO_START_4": "Yeah, me too. We’re in a time loop. Only you and me are aware of it.",
		"GABBRO_START_5": "Oh, yes, I remember. So... something went wrong, right?",
		"GABBRO_START_6": "Yes. Let’s try again.",
		"GABBRO_START_7": "Ummm... makes sense. Hornfels didn’t believe me when I told them I keep dying.",
		"GABBRO_START_8": "You seem comfortable here. By the way, we’re celebrating Christmas in the Village. Do you want to join?",
		"GABBRO_START_9": "M-m-m... I don’t know. I feel bored here, to be honest.",
		"GABBRO_START_10": "All this depressing rain, you know?",
		"GABBRO_START_11": "But on the other hand... I’m also too bored to fly anywhere or get in your ship.",
		"GABBRO_START_12": "Here's an idea, just blow up your ship so we can both die and initiate a new loop! I’ll be back in my ship when it starts and I can fly home to Timber Hearth.",
		"GABBRO_START_13": "I never realized you were such a lazy person before. And so morbid.",
		"GABBRO_START_14": "Ha-ha, yep! That’s me.",
		"GABBRO_START_15": "So... I’m waiting for ship explosion! Hurry up and kill me already so we can start a new loop.",
		"GABBRO_START_16": "Um. The thing is... my ship is already destroyed.",
		"GABBRO_START_17": "Sure. I’m working on it.",
		"GABBRO_START_18": "No luck then. Try not to screw this up next loop!",
		"GABBRO_START_19": "Got it! I’ll be here.",

		// Gabbro tree
		"GABBRO_TREE_1": "Hey! That was a really huge explosion! Are you alright?",
		"GABBRO_TREE_2": "I’m alright, Gabbro.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_3": "Meh. I could have just brought you here without dying.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_4": "Good! I already miss my hammock.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_5": "Yes?",
		"GABBRO_TREE_6": "Don’t you have a strange feeling about this place?",
		"GABBRO_TREE_7": "Nothing.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_8": "You feel that too? Seems like the time loop is shifting for everyone near the tree... Maybe it’s because of all the Nomai wires we used to light it up.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_9": "At least, that’s just my guess.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_10": "See ya!",
		"GABBRO_TREE_11": "Don’t be a snob, it was fun at least!",

		// Hal
		"HAL_START_1": "Hey! Are you feeling nervous about your first launch? I know that feeling! I’m nervous about it too!",
		"HAL_START_2": "You’ll be the first astronaut with a Nomai translator. I’m so excited about this!",
		"HAL_START_3": "Hal, can you write down a message in Nomai for me?",
		"HAL_START_4": "I think I’m good, Hal. I gotta go.",
		"HAL_START_5": "What are you doing with this rock?",
		"HAL_START_6": "That’s what I’m talking about! Good luck in space!",
		"HAL_START_7": "I’m just practicing writing in Nomai. Since I made a Nomai translator, I should be able to write in their language.",
		"HAL_START_8": "I actually don’t know what their language is called. Whatever... no one could read it anyway.",
		"HAL_START_9": "True. Good luck with it.",
		"HAL_START_10": "Sure! As you can see, I’m already practicing. So, this must be for testing the translator, right?",
		"HAL_START_11": "Of course. Please write: \"Dear Solanum, I’m inviting you to the Village to celebrate Christmas!\"",
		"HAL_START_12": "That’s... uh... oddly specific. Are we celebrating something? Ah, actually nevermind.",
		"HAL_START_13": "Let’s see if I can do this...",
		"HAL_START_14": "Good luck in space, friend!",
		"HAL_START_15": "Thanks! I gotta go.",

		// Hal final
		"HAL_FINAL_1": "Whoa, I see now what you meant about celebrating!",
		"HAL_FINAL_2": "Sure, and see what I did with your rock! I invited a living Nomai!",
		"HAL_FINAL_3": "Yep. It’s very cool.",
		"HAL_FINAL_4": "UNBELIEVABLE! Wait, stop, maybe it’s an illusion? Some sort of hologram technology?",
		"HAL_FINAL_5": "Or am I just dreaming? It’s too good to be true!",
		"HAL_FINAL_6": "What do we do next? Maybe ask Hornfels?",
		"HAL_FINAL_7": "S-s-sorry. I’m literally speechless.",

		// Hal rock
		"HAL_ROCK_1": "Alright, here you go.",
		"HAL_ROCK_2": "I know the writing is not perfect, but who knows... maybe I am the last person alive who knows this language.",
		"HAL_ROCK_3": "Thank you! Bye!",
		"HAL_ROCK_4": "So, what are you going to do with that rock? I’m very curious.",
		"HAL_ROCK_5": "Hmm, maybe I’ll show it to a living Nomai.",
		"HAL_ROCK_6": "Ha-ha-ha. Ha-haha-ha.",
		"HAL_ROCK_7": "Very funny.",
		"HAL_ROCK_8": "Sorry, I can’t talk with you right now.",
		"HAL_ROCK_9": "Your joke was just too good!",
		"HAL_ROCK_10": "Good luck in space, friend!",

		// Hornfels final
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_1": "What a beautiful tree! And everyone is here!",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_2": "Thank you for such a surprise, thank you a lot.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_3": "I’m glad all our friends are here.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_4": "So what’s next?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_5": "Yes, I don’t remember the last time we had such a gathering. All together.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_6": "So what’s next?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_7": "The lights are very nice, but I think we are missing a final detail to top it off.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_8": "We need something bright and shiny to put right on the top of the tree!",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_9": "Can you bring something like that from the observatory?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_10": "Sure, I’m on my way.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_11": "We need something bright and shiny to put in on the top of the tree. See if you can find something like that up in the observatory.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_13": "Thanks.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_14": "I’ll be here.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_15": "There should be something in the observatory.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_17": "So, did you find something?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_18": "Yes, take a look at the top!",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_19": "What exactly do we need?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_20": "Nope, not yet.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_21": "Woah! That’s exactly what we needed.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_22": "So, are we ready to celebrate?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_23": "Yes, I am ready.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_24": "Not yet. Please, give me a minute.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_25": "Alright. Merry Christmas then!",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_26": "Thank you for everything you’ve done, friend.",

		// Marl
		"MARL_START_1": "Hey! You see that tree? That's my work. Impressive, eh?",
		"MARL_START_2": "Yes, the tree is very impressive.",
		"MARL_START_3": "That’s what I’m talking about! Good luck in space!",
		"MARL_START_4": "Good luck on your flight. We’re waiting for your mission to be completed.",
		"MARL_START_5": "Marl, Tektite is asking for your help. There’s a bramble seed on Timber Hearth and it’s gro...",
		"MARL_START_6": "GROWING FAST?!",
		"MARL_START_7": "We need to cut down this bush as soon as possible! I’m going to Tektite!",

		// Marl final
		"MARL_FINAL_1": "No way! Everyone is here, whoa. Thank you for bringing them back!",
		"MARL_FINAL_2": "Sure! That was fun.",
		"MARL_FINAL_3": "I can imagine. Let’s ask Hornfels what we’re doing next.",
		"MARL_FINAL_4": "As I said, you better ask Hornfels.",

		// Player NPC ship
		"NPC_PLAYER_SHIP_1": "Let me see you drive. Are you better than me at it or not?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_SHIP_2": "Oh, we’re home already.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_SHIP_3": "We’ll go home soon. Just wait a bit.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_SHIP_4": "Oh, that was fast!",
		"NPC_PLAYER_SHIP_5": "So, are you the better one at driving?",

		// Player NPC start
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_1": "...Whoa?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_2": "May I invite you to...",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_3": "You?!",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_4": "Me?! You mean invite yourself?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_5": "You mean invite yourself?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_6": "To the Christmas party, huh?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_7": "I have the same memories as you, except for this loop, you know.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_8": "I just had an idea. It’s crazy but .. why not?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_9": "...Okay.. I guess.. are we going home?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_10": "Let’s get into the ship then.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_11": "Just don’t go anywhere, I just have to bring our ship closer.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_12": "I’m so sorry... but our ship is not functioning... Unfortunately, I can’t help.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_13": "I’ll be right back.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_14": "See ya!",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_15": "Cool, I’ll wait for you in my...",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_16": "...your ship.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_17": "I was wondering which version of us was better...",
		"NPC_PLAYER_START_18": "Now I know! I’m definitely a better pilot than you!",

		// Player NPC tree
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! To me.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_2": "Yes, and to me as well!",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_3": "Yep. Bye.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_4": "Thanks.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_5": "Aren't you worried about all this time travel stuff?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_6": "What do you mean?",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_7": "Well, for one there’s the thing about everything seeing us both at the same time... Bit of a time paradox or something...",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_8": "I'm sure it'll be fine. What's the worst that could happen? It's not like anything is going to explode!",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_9": "Yes, that’s exactly what I would have said too.",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_10": "You could also say one of us is just someone in a very good costume. No time travel there!",
		"NPC_PLAYER_TREE_11": "That's just what I was thinking.",

		// Porphy
		"PORPHY_TREE_1": "Heyo, hatchling!",
		"PORPHY_TREE_2": "How are you feeling before your big launch?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_3": "Hey! I’m good.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_4": "What is this barrel in the center?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_5": "Are you happy about all the snow?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_6": "Well, personally I prefered the previous climate.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_7": "But honestly this temperature is much better for storing all the barrels of sap-wine.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_8": "Okay, got it. I gotta go.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_9": "Glad to hear it! You know how important our space program is, we all believe in you! Hornfels especially.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_10": "Sure! By the way, what's up with this barrel in the center of the Village?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_11": "Oh, yes, it’s the biggest barrel I have in my collection. You like it?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_12": "The geyser in the center of the village has been inactive recently so we had to block off the hole for safety. Maybe the wine in the barrel will end up having a different taste now?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_13": "Anyway, I feel like with this tree and all the lights it was totally worth it.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_15": "Bye!",
		"PORPHY_TREE_16": "And good luck!",
		"PORPHY_TREE_17": "Again.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_18": "It’s you again!",
		"PORPHY_TREE_19": "What I can help you with?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_20": "Nothing actually.",
		"PORPHY_TREE_21": "Are you happy about all the snow?",
		"PORPHY_TREE_22": "Remind me, what's up with this barrel in the center of the Village?",

		// Prisoner start
		"PRISONER_START_1": "...",
		"PRISONER_START_2": "Um... Hello!",

		// Riebeck ship
		"RIEBECK_SHIP_1": "I like your ship! It’s very cozy. Please let me know when we will land at the Village.",
		"RIEBECK_SHIP_2": "Welcome back to Timber Hearth!",
		"RIEBECK_SHIP_3": "I’ll let you know. Keep playing that banjo, Riebeck!",
		"RIEBECK_SHIP_4": "Cool! Let’s GO!",
		"RIEBECK_SHIP_5": "So where are we now? Maybe we should land closer to the Village?",

		// Riebeck start
		"RIEBECK_START_1": "Oh, hello! Are you here to help me out?",
		"RIEBECK_START_2": "Just... how? I mean... how did you end up here?",
		"RIEBECK_START_3": "Yep, my ship should be nearby. Let’s get in.",
		"RIEBECK_START_4": "Hold on, I’ll bring my ship a little closer.",
		"RIEBECK_START_5": "I’m so sorry... but my ship is not functioning now... Unfortunately I can’t help.",
		"RIEBECK_START_6": "Well, I’d like to see how you’d react if a piece of the planet broke off and fell right behind you!",
		"RIEBECK_START_7": "I had barely any time to react, so I took all the gravity crystals I had and I found a safe new place. Logically, from this side, I won't ever fall DOWN.",
		"RIEBECK_START_8": "You get it? Ha-ha!",
		"RIEBECK_START_9": "I got you, Riebeck. Glad to see you’re alive and... safe. Kind of.",
		"RIEBECK_START_10": "So... can you help me then?",
		"RIEBECK_START_11": "Of course! Just be careful here.",
		"RIEBECK_START_12": "Oh, that’s really bad... I guess I’ll just stay here for a while then...",

		// Riebeck tree
		"RIEBECK_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! We’re finally home.",
		"RIEBECK_TREE_2": "We missed you!",
		"RIEBECK_TREE_3": "Wow, I really like the decorations on this tree... and the barrel.",
		"RIEBECK_TREE_4": "WAIT, IS THAT A REAL NOMAI??",
		"RIEBECK_TREE_5": "Yes, her name is Solanum. I met her on the Quantum Moon.",
		"RIEBECK_TREE_6": "Ha-ha! It’s just somebody in a costume, right? The Nomai are all extinct, remember?",
		"RIEBECK_TREE_7": "WOAH! A fantastic living Nomai from the Quantum Moon! COOL!",
		"RIEBECK_TREE_8": "This is a really good costume, I would say! But yeah, you’re right...",

		"SLATE_START_1": "Hey-hey! There’s our pilot!",
		"SLATE_START_2": "All travellers are here!",
		"SLATE_START_3": "Yes, I’m ready for my first voyage.",
		"SLATE_START_4": "Could you repeat what your plan is?",
		"SLATE_START_5": "Is it winter here or something?",
		"SLATE_START_6": "Alright, you’ll need to get the launch codes from Hornfels at the observatory, but hear me out: as you can see, winter has come to our Village, which means we’re going to celebrate Christmas!",
		"SLATE_START_7": "We had to remove some inactive geysers to make space for a glorious tree and our celebration plans. We even found some strange Nomai wires there.",
		"SLATE_START_8": "Celebration plan?",
		"SLATE_START_9": "But not all the geysers were inactive, were they?",
		"SLATE_START_10": "Yes, some of them are still active. It’s snowing a bit. Marl chopped down this beautiful tree, and I made the lights, but...",
		"SLATE_START_11": "...sometimes the blue ones shine too bright, like they’re overloaded with energy. Weird.",
		"SLATE_START_12": "Anyway, it seems like everyone is happy with winter. You should go talk to them before liftoff.",
		"SLATE_START_13": "Sure. Can’t wait to begin my space adventure!",
		"SLATE_START_14": "Okay, thanks for reminding me.",
		"SLATE_START_15": "Umm, I’m not sure. You can ask Porphy about this.",
		"SLATE_START_16": "So, what’s the celebration plan?",
		"SLATE_START_17": "Regarding the celebration, we need to bring all the travellers back home. I asked Esker a few times to help, but he keeps forgetting, as if we had never even had this conversation!",
		"SLATE_START_18": "Since it’s your launch day and there are no other pilots here, it will be your mission to bring them all back. You can start with Esker, actually.",
		"SLATE_START_19": "We want this to be a surprise for Hornfels and Hal, since they're always so busy working in the observatory, so please don’t tell them anything. Let me know when everyone is here so we can start the celebration.",
		"SLATE_START_20": "Great plan! I can’t wait to bring them all back.",
		"SLATE_START_21": "You need to find all the travellers, tell them about the celebration, and bring them here.",
		"SLATE_START_22": "Hornfels should be kept in the dark about this until everyone is here. It's a surprise!",
		"SLATE_START_24": "Okay, thanks for reminding me.",
		"SLATE_START_25": "Yes! It’s too quiet around here. We need their music, or else no Christmas magic will ever happen. So...",
		"SLATE_START_26": "Do you have any questions left?",
		"SLATE_START_27": "Is it a little scout?",
		"SLATE_START_28": "Nope, everyhing is clear to me.",
		"SLATE_START_31": "Good. I’ll be here if you need me.",
		"SLATE_START_32": "Sure. I’ll be here.",
		"SLATE_START_33": "Yeah, I made an upgrade for your scout. Now it has a little Nomai gravity crystal on it! You can launch it onto the wall and literally stand horizontally. It’s neat, you should give it a try.",
		"SLATE_START_34": "Sounds good!",
		"SLATE_START_35": "Just be careful using it in places where you’re not supposed to be standing. That just makes it even more dangerous to fall, so keep that in mind.",
		"SLATE_START_35.1": "I also don’t recommend to launch it inside your ship since you already have one in there. I’m not sure that’s safe to mix artificial gravity fields like that.",
		"SLATE_START_36": "Good point. Thanks.",
		"SLATE_START_37": "Great job, hatchling! I’m glad all our friends are here and the music is playing.",
		"SLATE_START_38": "Are we ready to tell Hornfels and Hal? Do you want to invite anyone else?",
		"SLATE_START_39": "Actually, I need more time to invite someone else.",
		"SLATE_START_40": "Yes, let’s get started.",
		"SLATE_START_41": "Just kidding! All the travelers are here already. Who else would you like to invite?",
		"SLATE_START_42": "Actually, nevermind. Just tell me whenever we ready to start.",
		"SLATE_START_43": "Yes, I’ll let you know.",
		"SLATE_START_44": "Let’s start.",
		"SLATE_START_45": "So, are you we ready to tell Hornfels and Hal? Are you done with other \"invites?\"",
		"SLATE_START_46": "No, not yet. I’ll let you know.",
		"SLATE_START_47": "Yes, let’s start.",
		"SLATE_START_48": "Okay, I’ll go get Hornfels and Hal.",
		"SLATE_START_49": "Merry Christmas!",
		"SLATE_START_50": "Actually, nevermind.",

		// Slate final
		"SLATE_FINAL_1": "You did very well, hatchling!",
		"SLATE_FINAL_2": "All the travellers are back, and I can already feel the magical Christmas spirit!",
		"SLATE_FINAL_3": "I’m glad all our friends are here.",
		"SLATE_FINAL_4": "What should I do next?",
		"SLATE_FINAL_5": "Sure! This probably wouldn’t have happened without your help.",
		"SLATE_FINAL_6": "You should ask Hornfels, but I’m pretty sure we’re almost ready.",
		"SLATE_FINAL_7": "Alright.",
		"SLATE_FINAL_8": "See ya!",
		"SLATE_FINAL_9": "Huh?",
		"SLATE_FINAL_10": "Nothing.",
