		// Chert start
		"CHERT_START_1": "Hello there! Is this your first launch? Welcome to the Hourglass Twins.",
		"CHERT_START_2": "Yes, it is. What are you doing here exactly?",
		"CHERT_START_3": "Let's celebrate Christmas! I'm helping the travelers get home for the celebration.",
		"CHERT_START_4": "Star charts, you know. This is a great place to spot astronomical events, such as supernovae.",
		"CHERT_START_5": "I've actually seen a couple today. It's  strange, since they're very rare.",
		"CHERT_START_6": "I see.",
		"CHERT_START_7": "So, what can I help you with?",
		"CHERT_START_8": "Let's celebrate Christmas! I'm helping the travelers get home for the celebration.",
		"CHERT_START_9": "Nothing. Have a nice day!",
		"CHERT_START_10": "What do you mean? You want me to just leave here and interrupt such important work? <![CDATA[<i>]]>Absolutely not.<![CDATA[</i>]]>",

		"CHERT_START_10.1": "By the way, is my friend Gabbro there already?",
		"CHERT_START_10.2": "Nope, not yet.",
		"CHERT_START_10.3": "Yep! You should join us too.",
		"CHERT_START_10.4": "If Gabbro not there, me neither then. Ask them first, then I'll think about it.",
		"CHERT_START_10.5": "Alright. Go on, continue telling me why should I leave this place and abandon my entire work.",
		"CHERT_START_10.6": "So, is Gabbro there already?",

		"CHERT_START_11": "Oh, the thing is, we're in a time loop, and the sun is about to go supernova. I've seen it happen many times now. Also, I've already explored everything, so you might as well go back home.",
		"CHERT_START_12": "Ha-ha, you're very funny! Go on, tell me everything you know then.",
		"CHERT_START_13": "The Eye of the Universe was found by species from a nearby solar system, and their cloaked ship is still here.",
		"CHERT_START_14": "Uh-huh...",
		"CHERT_START_15": "The Nomai came from another solar system too, but they were not able to find the Eye because its signal was blocked by the first species.",
		"CHERT_START_16": "Uh-huh.. go on...",
		"CHERT_START_17": "The Nomai made a time-loop machine to find the Eye by trial and error but died when ghost matter from the Interloper blanketed the solar system.",
		"CHERT_START_18": "Wow. I was expecting you to say something like <![CDATA[<i>]]>\"Sure, I was joking, gotcha! \"<![CDATA[</i>]]> but... this...",
		"CHERT_START_20": "It sounds unbelievable... <![CDATA[<i>]]>all of it!<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_21": "But alright, let's make a deal: I will go to Timber Hearth if you can prove everything you said.",
		"CHERT_START_22": "Sure! I already know the exact things you're about to ask: secret information that only you could know, unknown Nomai tech, and any other kind of tech.",
		"CHERT_START_23": "Alright! How do we do this?",
		"CHERT_START_24": "So, if you're saying you're in a time loop, you can prove it by telling me something that <![CDATA[<i>]]>only I could know.<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_25": "You can say: <![CDATA[<i>]]>\"Chert, I know that only you know who the inventor of Jumbo Marshmallows is\".<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_26": "Who is it?",
		"CHERT_START_27": "Alright, will that be enough?",
		"CHERT_START_28": "It's a big secret. Maybe one day you will know, but for now, it's the only thing I can say.",
		"CHERT_START_29": "Alright, will that be enough?",
		"CHERT_START_30": "No, since you're saying you are Mr. \"I know everything\", I'm asking you to bring something new to the table.",
		"CHERT_START_31": "I mean, any unknown Nomai technology, and don't you dare take anything from the museum!",
		"CHERT_START_32": "What else did you say? The other species' ship is still here? Cool, bring me a piece of their tech, and we're good.",
		"CHERT_START_33": "So, the deal is the secret phrase, some unknown Nomai tech, and something significant from another civilization's tech. Deal?",
		"CHERT_START_34": "Deal. You better prepare to fly home!",
		"CHERT_START_35": "Chert, I know that only you know who the inventor of Jumbo Marshmallows is.",
		"CHERT_START_36": "Oh, that was witty. Tell me that in the next loop in case you're not lying.",
		"CHERT_START_37": "Okay, I will. Bye.",
		"CHERT_START_38": "Chert, I know that only you know who the inventor of Jumbo Marshmallows is.",
		"CHERT_START_39": "Good luck with it!",
		"CHERT_START_40": "Ha-ha.",
		"CHERT_START_41": "So, I'm waiting for all the proof.",
		"CHERT_START_43": "Here's the Nomai warp core. They used it to enable the time loop machine.",
		"CHERT_START_44": "Here's the strangers' tech.",
		"CHERT_START_45": "Take a look at this item.",
		"CHERT_START_46": "So, I've done everything you asked for. Now will you come home and celebrate?",
		"CHERT_START_47": "I'll be right back.",
		"CHERT_START_48": "B-o-o-o-ring. Bring something significant!",
		"CHERT_START_49": "Wow. That really is the one thing that only I knew. Well, not anymore.",
		"CHERT_START_50": "Sure! I'll prove everything.",
		"CHERT_START_51": "I... I'm speechless... wait, if it's enabling the time loop and I can't see any wires connecting it to anything...",
		"CHERT_START_52": "OH NO! PUT IT BACK! NOW!",
		"CHERT_START_53": "Oh, don't be upset Chert. I'll fix it. Calm down!",
		"CHERT_START_54": "Uh... easy for you to say! Okay, take a deep breath... inhale... exhale...",
		// "CHERT_START_55": "Anyway...",
		"CHERT_START_56": "What an interesting artifact! It seems like the main concept of their technology is some sort of light or flame, am I right? Good job!",
		"CHERT_START_57": "Yes. They were all about flames and lights.",

		"CHERT_START_57.1": "To be honest, this is mindblowing.. I was not expecting that...",

		"CHERT_START_58": "Okay... you won. My world-view is <![CDATA[<i>]]>shattered<![CDATA[</i>]]> and I don't feel like I'm doing anything important here, so... let's go celebrate Christmas!",
		"CHERT_START_59": "Yay! Let's go, my ship is nearby.",
		"CHERT_START_60": "Wait a sec. I need to bring my ship closer.",
		"CHERT_START_61": "Oh no, my ship is destroyed. Sorry.",
		"CHERT_START_62": "Oh well, it's alright. I don't really need your ship. Mine is functioning. See ya!",
		"CHERT_START_63": "Bon voyage!",
		"CHERT_START_64": "Actually... yeah. That's what I was thinking too. Nice guess!",
		"CHERT_START_65": "So, <![CDATA[<i>]]>are you serious about all this?<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_66": "Yes! Let's get down to business.",

		"CHERT_START_67": "Could you remind me what's left?",
		"CHERT_START_68": "Sure, let's see what's left...",
		"CHERT_START_69": "You told me the phrase and now you need to bring some unknown Nomai tech and strangers tech, as you said.",
		"CHERT_START_70": "Thanks for reminding, Chert. I'll be right back.",
		"CHERT_START_71": "You told me the phrase and showed the Nomai warp core. Now you just need to bring some piece of strangers tech.",
		"CHERT_START_72": "You told me the phrase and showed the strangers artifact. Now I'm waiting you to bring some unknown Nomai tech.",


		// Chert tree
		"CHERT_TREE_1": "Hey! I wanted to ask.. how do you cope with all your knowledge?",
		"CHERT_TREE_2": "I just do. I'm okay, Chert.",
		"CHERT_TREE_3": "I can imagine...",
		"CHERT_TREE_4": "Oh, is that what those Strangers looked like?",
		"CHERT_TREE_5": "Yes, exactly.",
		"CHERT_TREE_6": "They were a little creepy and had just two eyes!",
		"CHERT_TREE_7": "Yeah, they were very different looking, and a little creepy.",

		// Ernesto
		"ERNESTO_START_1": "...",
		"ERNESTO_START_2": "Oh, Ernesto, you shine so bright!",
		"ERNESTO_START_3": "We need your light to finally start!",

		// Esker ship
		"ESKER_SHIP_1": "I don't remember the last time I was in a spaceship...",
		"ESKER_SHIP_2": "Alright, we're here! Let's go celebrate!",
		"ESKER_SHIP_3": "I'll let you know when we land near the Village.",
		"ESKER_SHIP_8": "You even brought your chair? Really, Esker?",
		"ESKER_SHIP_9": "Yes! What, you wanted me to leave it on the Attlerock?",
		"ESKER_SHIP_10": "No way.",
		"ESKER_SHIP_4": "Let's go! Merry Christmas!",
		"ESKER_SHIP_5": "So, the flight is over?",
		"ESKER_SHIP_7": "Yes, we're here! Let's go celebrate!",
		"ESKER_SHIP_6": "No, but I'll tell you when we're about to land.",

		// Esker start
		"ESKER_START_1": "Hey-hey! So you're here to bring me home, right?",
		"ESKER_START_2": "Wait, what? How did you know?",
		// I change this line since Esker isn't in the loop yet so maybe Slate didn't say it to the player this loop
		"ESKER_START_3": "Well... I get lonely up here, so I listen in on the Village with my signalscope a lot... I overheard Slate talking about it.",
		"ESKER_START_4": "Oh, I see... You scare me sometimes, Esker.",
		"ESKER_START_5": "So... what's next? Are we going home?",
		"ESKER_START_6": "Yes! I need you to celebrate Christmas. Let's go!",
		"ESKER_START_7": "Yes, but don't go anywhere. I need to bring my ship closer.",
		"ESKER_START_8": "I'm sorry, Esker, but it seems like my ship isn't working anymore. My bad.",
		"ESKER_START_9": "Hold on, I need to do something first.",
		"ESKER_START_10": "Alright, I'll wait for you!",
		"ESKER_START_11": "No celebration then? Sad... We can still hang out here around my campfire, you know...",
		"ESKER_START_12": "Gotcha! I'll wait then.",

		// Esker tree
		"ESKER_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! Gotta say you're good pilot.",
		"ESKER_TREE_2": "Thanks! I know I'm pretty good at it.",
		"ESKER_TREE_3": "Do you know anything about Jumbo?",
		"ESKER_TREE_4": "Yes, you're also very modest.",
		"ESKER_TREE_5": "Who? What?",
		"ESKER_TREE_6": "Actually... nevermind...",

		// Feldspar note
		"FELDSPAR_NOTE": "Okay, I'm leaving this damned place now. I'm not sure if I'll succeed without my ship, but at least I'll try. - Feldspar.",

		// Feldspar ship
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_1.1": "Wow! I think that's the angler I followed! Not sure if it's dangerous since it's so small.",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_1": "Nice ship, by the way! I'll ask Slate to make a new one for me like this. Let me know when we land near the Village, okay?",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_2": "We're already home, welcome back!",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_3": "Sure! I'll let you know.",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_4": "Yay! Thanks for the ride. Let's go celebrate!",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_5": "Are we home yet, hatchling?",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_6": "Nope, not yet. I'll let you know when we're there.",

		// Feldspar start
		"FELDSPAR_START_1": "Hey bud! I'm glad you found me. Can you help me escape from this cursed place?",
		"FELDSPAR_START_2": "Why did you leave the anglerfish skeleton? It was safe there!",
		"FELDSPAR_START_3": "Sure! Let's go.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_4": "Don't go anywhere, I'll bring the ship closer.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_5": "I'm so sorry... but the ship is not functioning... we're stuck here.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_6": "It was relaxing there, but eventually I was up for more adventuring. I saw a little anglerfish and thought it could help me fly away from Dark Bramble, so I followed it and... well... then I ended up here...",
		"FELDSPAR_START_7": "Pure luck! I was so scared that I wasn't able to move, but it seems like I was so still and quiet that the anglerfish could not see me. Ha-ha! Another mystery solved!",
		"FELDSPAR_START_8": "Wow, yeah that really is pure luck!",
		"FELDSPAR_START_9": "So... can you get us out of here?",
		"FELDSPAR_START_10": "Don't go anywhere? Ha-ha.",
		"FELDSPAR_START_11": "Oh my... what are we gonna do now?",

		// Feldspar tree
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! I have to admit, I really missed the Village.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_2": "Glad you're here, Feldspar.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_4": "Yeah, me too. Being the greatest space adventurer can wait sometimes, you know?",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_5": "Who's that? That guy looks EXACTLY like you.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_6": "Well, they are literally me. From the past.",
		// Changed from nephew to be gender neutral since Hearthians have no gender
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_7": "My cousin.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_8": "Ummm, I don't know, actually.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_9": "Ha-ha-ha. Very funny. VERY.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_10": "Really? I never knew that. Hm.",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_11": "Okay, but it's weird.",

		// Gabbro start
		"GABBRO_START_1": "Hey, it's you! Congrats on your first launch.",
		"GABBRO_START_2": "I don't know why, but I keep dying repeatedly. That sounds weird, huh?",
		"GABBRO_START_3": "Yes, we already had this conversation.",
		"GABBRO_START_4": "Yeah, me too. We're in a time loop. Only you and me are aware of it.",
		"GABBRO_START_5": "Oh, yes, I remember. So... something went wrong, right?",
		"GABBRO_START_6": "Yes. Let's try again.",
		"GABBRO_START_7": "Ummm... makes sense. Hornfels didn't believe me when I told them I keep dying.",
		"GABBRO_START_8": "You seem comfortable here. By the way, we're celebrating Christmas in the Village. Do you want to join?",
		"GABBRO_START_9": "M-m-m... I don't know. I feel bored here, to be honest.",
		"GABBRO_START_10": "All this depressing rain, you know?",
		"GABBRO_START_11": "But on the other hand... I'm also too bored to fly anywhere or get in your ship.",
		"GABBRO_START_12": "Here's an idea, just blow up your ship so we can both die and initiate a new loop! The excitement of it will snap me out of this funk, and I'll be back in my ship when it starts and I can fly home to Timber Hearth.",
		"GABBRO_START_13": "Make a big explosion with the ship?! Are you crazy?! Alright, let's do it!",
		"GABBRO_START_14": "Ha-ha, yep! <![CDATA[<i>*whistling*</i>]]>",
		"GABBRO_START_14.1": "By the way, remember the new exhibit at the observatory? There is <![CDATA[<i>]]>a secret<![CDATA[</i>]]> associated with it. But I will tell about it only on Timber Hearth.",
		"GABBRO_START_15": "So... I'm waiting for ship explosion! Hurry up and kill me already so we can start a new loop... and tell you <![CDATA[<i>]]>the secret!<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"GABBRO_START_16": "Um. The thing is... my ship is already destroyed.",
		"GABBRO_START_17": "Sure. I'm working on it.",
		"GABBRO_START_18": "No luck then. Try not to screw this up next loop!",
		"GABBRO_START_19": "Got it! I'll be here.",

		// Gabbro tree
		"GABBRO_TREE_1": "Hey! That was a really huge explosion! Are you alright?",
		"GABBRO_TREE_2": "I'm alright, Gabbro. Time loop, remember?",
		"GABBRO_TREE_3": "Meh. I could have just brought you here without dying.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_4": "Good! I already miss my hammock.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_5": "Yes?",
		"GABBRO_TREE_6": "Don't you have a strange feeling about this place?",
		"GABBRO_TREE_7": "Nothing.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_8": "You feel that too? Seems like the time loop is shifting for everyone near the tree... Maybe it's because of all the Nomai wires we used to light it up.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_9": "At least, that's just my guess.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_10": "See ya!",
		"GABBRO_TREE_11": "Don't be a snob, it was fun at least!",
		"GABBRO_TREE_12": "What about that <![CDATA[<i>]]>secret?<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"GABBRO_TREE_13": "Yes! Almost forgot about it. The Deep Space Satellite once detected a strange object covering our sun, but only from a certain angle.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_14": "One day I flew there without telling anyone, and I found this bizarre ship! It didn't look Nomain in origin. Honestly, it terrified me, so I left immediately and told no-one about it.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_15": "But hey, hard to fear anything when in a time loop, right? If you want, I can send you the coordinates to it, if you want to visit it someday",
		"GABBRO_TREE_16": "Yes, please share!",
		"GABBRO_TREE_17": "No, thanks, I'm good.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_18": "Okay, I understand! Some things are best left hidden. Just let me know if you ever change your mind.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_19": "Alright, I'm uploading it to your ship log. It should be there when you get back to your ship.",
		"GABBRO_TREE_20": "I changed my mind, can you give me the coordinates to the strange ship?",


		// Hal
		"HAL_START_1": "Hey! Are you feeling nervous about your first launch? I know that feeling! I'm nervous about it too!",
		"HAL_START_2": "You'll be the first astronaut with a Nomai translator. I'm so excited about it!",
		"HAL_START_3": "Hal, can you write down a message in Nomai for me?",
		"HAL_START_4": "I think I'm good, Hal. I gotta go.",
		"HAL_START_5": "What are you doing with this rock?",
		"HAL_START_6": "That's what I'm talking about! Good luck in space!",
		"HAL_START_7": "I'm just practicing my <![CDATA[<i>]]>Nomai writing.<![CDATA[</i>]]> I learned a lot about their language when making the Nomai translator, so I thought I should be able to write in their language.",
		"HAL_START_8": "I actually don't know what their language is called. Whatever... no one else can read it anyway.",
		"HAL_START_9": "True. Good luck with it.",
		"HAL_START_10": "Sure! As you can see, I'm already practicing. So, this must be for testing the translator, right?",
		"HAL_START_11": "Of course. Please write: <![CDATA[<i>]]>\"Dear Solanum, I'm inviting you to the Village to celebrate Christmas!\"<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"HAL_START_12": "That's... uh... <![CDATA[<i>]]>oddly specific.<![CDATA[</i>]]> Are we celebrating something? And it's addressed to who? Ah, actually nevermind.",
		"HAL_START_13": "Let's see if I can do this...",
		"HAL_START_14": "Good luck in space, friend!",
		"HAL_START_15": "Thanks! I gotta go.",

		// Hal final
		"HAL_FINAL_1": "Woah, I see now what you meant about celebrating!",
		"HAL_FINAL_2": "Sure, and see what I did with your rock! I used it to invite a living Nomai!",
		"HAL_FINAL_3": "Yep. It's very cool.",
		"HAL_FINAL_4": "UNBELIEVABLE! Wait, stop, maybe it's an illusion? Some sort of hologram technology?",
		"HAL_FINAL_5": "Or am I just dreaming? It's too good to be true!",
		"HAL_FINAL_6": "What do we do next? Maybe ask Hornfels?",
		"HAL_FINAL_7": "S-s-sorry. I'm literally speechless.",

		// Hal rock
		"HAL_ROCK_1": "Alright, here you go.",
		"HAL_ROCK_2": "I know the grammar isn't perfect, but who knows... I might very well be the last living person who knows this language!",
		"HAL_ROCK_3": "Thank you! Bye!",
		"HAL_ROCK_4": "So, what are you going to do with that rock? I'm very curious.",
		"HAL_ROCK_5": "Hmm, maybe I'll show it to a living Nomai.",
		"HAL_ROCK_6": "Ha-ha-ha. Ha-haha-ha.",
		"HAL_ROCK_7": "Very funny.",
		"HAL_ROCK_8": "Sorry, I can't talk with you right now.",
		"HAL_ROCK_9": "Your joke was just too good!",
		"HAL_ROCK_10": "Good luck in space, friend!",

		// Hornfels final
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_1": "What a beautiful tree! And everyone is here!",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_2": "Thank you for such a surprise, thank you a lot.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_3": "I'm glad all our friends are here.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_4": "So what's next?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_5": "Yes, I don't remember the last time we had such a gathering. All together.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_6": "So what's next?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_7": "The lights are very nice, but I think we are missing a final detail to top it off.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_8": "We need <![CDATA[<i>]]>something bright and shiny<![CDATA[</i>]]> to put right on the top of the tree!",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_9": "Can you bring something like that from the observatory?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_10": "Sure, I'll go check now.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_11": "We need something bright and shiny to put in on the top of the tree. See if you can find something like that up in the Observatory.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_13": "Thanks.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_14": "I'll be here.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_15": "There should be something in the Observatory.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_17": "So, did you find something?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_18": "Yes, take a look at the top!",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_19": "What exactly do we need?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_20": "Nope, not yet.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_21": "Woah! That's exactly what we needed.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_22": "So, are we ready to celebrate?",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_23": "Yes, I am ready.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_24": "Not yet. Please, give me a minute.",

		"SLATE_START_32": "Sure. I'll be here.",
		"SLATE_START_33": "Yeah, I've been upgrading our Little Scouts. If you try yours out, you'll notice it has a little Nomai gravity crystal on it! You can launch it at walls and literally stand horizontally. It's neat, you should give it a try.",
		"SLATE_START_34": "Sounds good!",
		"SLATE_START_35": "Just be careful using it in places where you're not supposed to be standing. That just makes it even more dangerous to fall, so keep that in mind.",
		"SLATE_START_35.1": "I also strongly recommend you don't launch it inside your ship. There's already a gravity crystal in there, I really don't think it's safe to mix artificial gravity fields like that.",
